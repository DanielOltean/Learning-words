Daniel Oltean, Learning words: An exploratory data analysis of the datasets "Age of acquisition" and "Concreteness"

===================================

This project performs an exploratory data analysis of the datasets "Age of acquisition" and "Concreteness" containing subjective word ratings for thousands of English words, constructed by the Center for Reading Research, Ghent, 
http://crr.ugent.be/programs-data/word-ratings. 

The project explored the age when we learn the most words; the types of words we learn; the correlations between the age of acquisition and the words' length, concreteness, and frequency in the current language. 

Using Python's TextBlob library, I also studied the correlation between the age of acquisition and word sentiments (the properties "polarity" and "subjectivity").
